Hello, I have been working on some articles for a while now. Some of them I was paid for. Unfortunately lately I got into an online debate on the fact that I was not disclosing it properly on my user page and my editing abilities were blocked. I have tried time after time to correct my ways according to what I was told was needed but was refused. At the moment I'm struggling since I still want to make some changes to an existing article that I have been working on. I was advised to write a requests for other editors to make these changes for me and did so on the article's talk page and on personal messages as well to different editors. I get complete ignore - so at this point I'm completely stuck! you can see my article and requests here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ran_Balicer any advice or help will be extremely appreciated.
