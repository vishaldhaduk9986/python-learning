The Nobel Prize in Physics is an annual award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to those who have made the most outstanding contributions to humanity through physics. It is widely regarded as the most prestigious award that a scientist can receive in that field. One of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895, the Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded since 1901, when the German physicist Wilhelm Röntgen was recognised for the discovery of X-rays. As of 2024, there have been 226 Nobel laureates in Physics. The prize consists of a medal (whose obverse bears a profile of Nobel), a diploma, and a monetary award. This 1931 group photograph includes three Nobel laureates in Physics in the front row – from left to right, Albert A. Michelson (1907), Albert Einstein (1921), and Robert Millikan (1923) – each of whom autographed the image. The photograph is in the collection of the Dibner Library of the History of Science and Technology at the Smithsonian Institution.
