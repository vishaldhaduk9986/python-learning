Once, a lion was sleeping in the jungle when a small mouse began to play on him. The lion woke up, caught the mouse in his paw, and intended to kill it. The mouse, frightened, begged for forgiveness. The lion felt pity and let the mouse go. 
Some days later, the same lion became trapped in a hunter's net. The mouse, remembering the lion's kindness, came to his aid. The mouse began to chew through the ropes of the net. Soon, the lion was free, and he thanked the mouse for saving his life.
