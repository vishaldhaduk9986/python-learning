# PR: Add Copilot PR helper and tests (co-pilot-week6)

## Prefill (PR body)

This PR adds a small, deterministic helper module `src/copilot_helpers.py` to generate PR summaries and review feedback for demos and tests. It also adds unit tests for the helper. The module is intentionally offline and avoids network calls so it is safe to run in CI and low-memory environments.

Key changes:

- src/copilot_helpers.py: helper functions to generate PR summaries, review comments, and to apply inline suggestions
- tests/test_copilot_helpers.py: unit tests for the helpers

Validation steps:

- Run `pytest -q` and confirm new tests pass
- Inspect `src/copilot_helpers.py` for deterministic heuristics

Risks:

- This module is a demo helper; do not wire it to production automation without adding rate limits and safety checks.

## Automated review feedback (generated)

The following heuristic review comments were generated by the Copilot-helper module. These are suggestions for reviewers; please treat them as starting points to refine.

1. General suggestion

- Add a short list of integration tests that exercise the happy path and one failure path.

2. Notes for maintainers

- The helper is deterministic and offline by design. If you plan to wire it into any automation, add safety checks, rate-limits, and clear testing around any automated comments it may post.

3. How to use this feedback

- Paste these bullets into the GitHub PR review UI (or add as comments on specific files). The file `src/copilot_helpers.py` also exports `generate_review_feedback()` which you can run locally to produce similar suggestions.
