Guild of Copy Editors' editing drive. The September 2025 backlog drive was a one-month-long effort by the Guild of Copy Editors to reduce the backlog of articles that require copy editing: those carrying the {{copy edit}} tag (also {{awkward}}, {{copy edit section}}, {{inappropriate person}}, and {{copy edit inline}}, and their redirects) or are listed on the GOCE Requests page. It began on 1 September, 00:00 (UTC), and ended on 30 September, 23:59 (UTC). Stay tuned for the next event.
